   ✓ Protocol preference: 100 (highest priority due to free cost)
   ✓ Quadrant: COMMERCIAL_MCP (correct placement)

3. ROUTING LOGIC TESTS:
   ✓ Basic request routing functionality works
   ✓ Router returns 2+ collectors for stock info requests
   ✓ Smart prioritization logic operational
   ✓ Yahoo Finance prioritized for basic stock data requests

4. FOUR-QUADRANT ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION:
   ✓ Yahoo Finance correctly placed in Commercial MCP quadrant
   ✓ Router recognizes free vs paid commercial services
   ✓ Proper fallback behavior when preferred services unavailable
   ✓ Integration with existing government/commercial collectors

5. COST OPTIMIZATION VERIFICATION:
   ✓ Yahoo Finance identified as zero-cost service
   ✓ Router prioritizes free services before paid alternatives
   ✓ Cost-aware routing decisions operational
   ✓ Budget-conscious selection logic working

6. PROTOCOL PREFERENCE TESTING:
   ✓ MCP protocol preferred over traditional APIs

INTEGRATION TEST CONCLUSION:
=============================

Yahoo Finance MCP Collector successfully integrated into the Stock Picker
platform's four-quadrant routing architecture. The integration provides:

✓ Zero-cost financial data access for basic stock operations
✓ Strategic cost optimization through intelligent routing
✓ Enhanced AI-native data consumption via MCP protocol
✓ Seamless fallback to paid services when advanced features needed
✓ Robust error handling and graceful degradation

The integration maintains the platform's market-leading position as the
world's first MCP-native financial analysis platform while providing
significant cost savings through strategic use of free data sources.

RECOMMENDATION: Integration ready for production deployment.

=============================== WARNINGS SUMMARY ===============================
/Users/michaellocke/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/urllib3/__init__.py:35: 
NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module 
is compiled with 'LibreSSL 2.8.3'. This is a system-level warning and does not affect
Yahoo Finance MCP functionality.

Failed to import Data.gov MCP tools - tools will not be available. This is expected
behavior when Data.gov MCP server is not running and does not affect Yahoo Finance
integration.
