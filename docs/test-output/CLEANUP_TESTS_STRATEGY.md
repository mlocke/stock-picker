## TDD Validation Results

### Test Failure Confirmation âœ…

All tests properly **FAIL** initially, confirming adherence to TDD principles:

```
FAIL app/services/cache/__tests__/RedisCache.cleanup.test.ts
FAIL app/services/websocket/__tests__/WebSocketManager.cleanup.test.ts
FAIL app/services/mcp/__tests__/MCPClient.cleanup.test.ts
FAIL app/services/__tests__/RealTimePipeline.cleanup.test.ts
FAIL app/services/__tests__/MemoryLeakDetection.test.ts
```

### Test Coverage Analysis

Current implementation coverage shows gaps that tests will drive:
- **MCPClient.ts**: 41.44% coverage - Missing cleanup implementations
- **DataFusionEngine.ts**: 11.16% coverage - Needs cleanup methods
- **QualityScorer.ts**: 18.33% coverage - Missing reset functionality

## Implementation Gaps Identified

The tests revealed these missing cleanup implementations:

### 1. RedisCache Issues
- Multiple shutdown calls not handled properly
- Backup connection cleanup incomplete
- Health check interval management needs improvement
- Memory leak prevention needs enhancement

### 2. WebSocket Manager Issues
- Event listener cleanup not implemented
- Timer management incomplete
- Memory leak prevention needs work
- Idempotent cleanup not ensured

### 3. MCP Client Issues
- Cache coordination between memory and Redis incomplete
- Fusion engine reset needs implementation
- Health check timer management missing
- Resource counting incomplete

### 4. Pipeline Integration Issues
- Complete lifecycle management incomplete
- Cross-component cleanup coordination needs work
- Memory leak detection and prevention incomplete

## Testing Strategy Highlights

### 1. Comprehensive Error Scenarios
- Network failures during cleanup
- Partial cleanup failures
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Concurrent cleanup attempts

### 2. Memory Management Focus
