- Rate limiting must be implemented to prevent unexpected API charges
- Fallback mechanisms must ensure platform stability when web intelligence unavailable

**Content Quality (ESSENTIAL)**:
- Web search results must be relevant to financial markets and investment decisions
- AI recommendations must provide genuine value and market context
- Content filtering must maintain high quality and credibility standards

**Performance Standards (REQUIRED)**:
- Web searches must complete within 2 seconds for good user experience
