/* Semantic Color System (inspired by industry leaders) */
--bull-primary: #00D084    /* Strong gains, high confidence predictions */
--bull-secondary: #10B981  /* Moderate gains, medium confidence */
--bear-primary: #EF4444    /* Strong losses, high confidence predictions */
--bear-secondary: #F87171  /* Moderate losses, medium confidence */
--neutral: #6B7280         /* Sideways/uncertain predictions */
--alert: #F59E0B          /* Important notifications, warnings */
--info: #3B82F6           /* Educational content, methodology */
--success: #059669        /* Successful actions, confirmations */
```

### Typography Scale for Financial Data

## üîÑ User Flow Analysis

### Onboarding Patterns Across Competitors

**Robinhood Approach: Immediate Value**
1. Name + Phone (social proof during signup)
2. Link bank account (trust building)
3. First stock suggestion (quick win)
4. Educational tooltips (contextual learning)

**TradingView Approach: Gradual Complexity**
1. Demo account with fake money
2. Basic chart with simple indicators
3. Progressive feature unlocks
4. Community features introduction

**Recommended for Stock Picker: Educational-First**
```
1. Demo Analysis: Show full analysis for AAPL (no signup required)
2. Value Demonstration: "See how our prediction performed over the last month"
3. Simple Signup: Email + password (no financial info yet)
4. First Analysis: Let user pick their first stock to analyze
5. Results Education: Explain each prediction component
6. Portfolio Creation: Offer to track their first analysis
```

### Error State Management

**Best Practices from Industry Leaders:**

**Data Unavailable (E*TRADE pattern):**
```
‚ùå "Error: No data found"
‚úÖ "Market data is currently unavailable. Try refreshing in a few moments."
+ [Refresh Button] + [Use Cached Data?]
```

**Analysis Failure (Charles Schwab pattern):**
```
‚ùå "Analysis failed"
‚úÖ "We couldn't complete the full analysis, but here's what we found:"
+ [Partial Results] + [Try Again] + [Report Issue]
```

## üß™ A/B Testing Framework for UX Improvements

### High-Impact Test Scenarios

**Test 1: Analysis Presentation**
- **Variant A**: All analysis results shown simultaneously
- **Variant B**: Progressive disclosure with user-controlled depth
- **Measure**: Completion rate, time spent, user comprehension

**Test 2: Confidence Display**
- **Variant A**: Percentage confidence (85% confident)
- **Variant B**: Visual confidence bars with labels (High/Medium/Low)
- **Measure**: User trust, prediction accuracy perception

**Test 3: Call-to-Action Placement**
- **Variant A**: "Add to Portfolio" at top of analysis
- **Variant B**: "Add to Portfolio" after user views full analysis
- **Measure**: Engagement quality, portfolio creation rate

### Success Metrics Framework

**User Engagement Quality**
- **Analysis Depth**: % of users viewing full breakdown
- **Learning Engagement**: Interactions with educational tooltips
- **Return Behavior**: Users completing multiple analyses

**Trust and Confidence**
- **Disclaimer Interaction**: Users reading methodology explanations
- **Data Source Verification**: Clicks on data source information
- **Uncertainty Handling**: How users react to low-confidence predictions

## üéØ Accessibility and Inclusive Design

### Screen Reader Optimization

**Financial Data Accessibility Patterns:**
```html
<!-- Price Display -->
<div role="region" aria-label="Stock price information">
  <span aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
    Apple stock price $150.25, up $2.10 (1.42%) today
  </span>
</div>

<!-- Analysis Results -->
<section aria-labelledby="analysis-heading">
  <h2 id="analysis-heading">Technical Analysis Results</h2>
  <div role="group" aria-describedby="confidence-desc">
    <span id="confidence-desc">Analysis confidence: High</span>
    <!-- Analysis content -->
  </div>
</section>
```

### High Contrast and Color-Blind Considerations

**Pattern Analysis from Fidelity and Vanguard:**
- Use patterns/textures in addition to color for data differentiation
- Implement 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum for all text
- Provide color customization options for user preferences
- Use semantic HTML for screen reader context

### Motor Accessibility

**Touch Target Optimization:**
- Minimum 44x44pt touch targets (iOS HIG standard)
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8pt minimum)
- Support for voice control and keyboard navigation
- Gesture alternatives for complex interactions

---

## ‚ö° Performance UX Considerations

### Real-Time Data Loading Strategies

**Industry Patterns:**
- **Skeleton Loading**: Show chart structure while data loads
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Load basic data first, enrich with details
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle slow connections with lighter data
- **Cache-First**: Show cached data immediately, update when fresh data arrives

### Perceived Performance Optimizations

**Visual Feedback Patterns:**
```
Loading State: Skeleton charts with subtle animation
Data Population: Smooth number counting animations
Error Recovery: Non-blocking error notifications
Success States: Quick positive feedback (checkmarks, success colors)
```

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Recommendations

### Component Architecture for UX Consistency

**Core UI Components Needed:**
```
1. StockCard (price, change, mini-chart)
2. AnalysisPanel (expandable sections)
3. ConfidenceIndicator (visual confidence display)
4. DataSourceBadge (transparency component)
5. EducationalTooltip (contextual learning)
6. ActionButton (primary CTAs)
7. LoadingStates (skeleton screens)
8. ErrorBoundary (graceful error handling)
```

### State Management for UX Flow

**User Journey State:**
```javascript
// Track user's analysis journey for personalization
const userJourneyState = {
  currentAnalysisDepth: 'basic', // basic | intermediate | advanced
  preferredDataView: 'visual',   // visual | tabular | mixed
  educationLevel: 'beginner',    // beginner | intermediate | expert
  trustIndicators: ['methodology', 'sources'], // what builds trust
  completedOnboarding: false
}
```

## üìä Competitive Differentiation Through UX

### Unique Value Propositions in User Experience

**1. Explanation-First Design**
Unlike competitors who hide their methodology, our UX puts explanation front and center:
- Every prediction comes with an expandable "Why?" section
- Visual reasoning flows showing how data points connect
- Comparison views showing what our analysis catches that others miss

**2. Educational Progressive Complexity**
Most platforms assume either novice or expert users:
- Adaptive complexity based on user engagement patterns
- Contextual learning opportunities at decision points
- "Train me up" mode for users who want to learn more

**3. Multi-Source Validation Visualization**
Show users when multiple data sources agree or disagree:
- Consensus indicators for predictions
- Conflicting data alerts with explanation
- Source reliability scores based on historical accuracy
