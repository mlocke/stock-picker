# Element Positioning Adjustment Process

## Overview
This document captures the iterative process of adjusting the positioning of elements using Playwright for visual testing and verification.

## Initial Request
Understand what element or elements need attention. 
1. Use playwright to take a baseline screenshot of the page or element.
2. Always save the screenshots in `docs/project/screenshots/` folder.
3. Always attempt to apply the simplest CSS changes first. It might not even be a CSS issue. An &nbsp; often works to add spacing.
4. If CSS changes are needed, try to use existing utility classes (e.g., Tailwind CSS classes) before adding custom CSS.
5. If custom CSS is needed, add it to the component's CSS file or inline styles as appropriate.
6. Take screenshots to verify the changes. If they are not satisfactory, iterate on the CSS changes and take new screenshots until the desired result is achieved.

## Process Documentation

### Iteration 1: Initial UX Agent Attempt

2. Use the ux-ui-specialist agent to employ playwright for screenshots
3. Use ux-ui-specialist agent to apply modifications
