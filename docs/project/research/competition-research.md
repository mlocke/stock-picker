	/* Positive metrics, gains */ --warning-amber: #f59e0b /* Neutral/caution indicators */
	--danger-red: #ef4444 /* Risk alerts, losses */ --trust-blue: #0066cc

```

### Typography Hierarchy (Inspired by eToro/Robinhood)

```css
/* Bold, confident typography for financial data */
.metric-display: 4rem, font-weight: 900  /* Large prediction percentages */
.section-header: 2.5rem, font-weight: 700 /* Analysis section titles */

.disclaimer: 0.875rem, font-weight: 400  /* Legal/risk disclaimers */
```
