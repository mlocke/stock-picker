## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Technology Decisions

#### Backend Stack

```
Language: Python 3.11+
Framework: FastAPI (async support, automatic OpenAPI)
Database: PostgreSQL (structured) + InfluxDB (time-series) + Redis (cache)
ML/Analysis: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Task Queue: Celery with Redis broker
```

#### Frontend Stack

```
Framework: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS (following design system)
Charts: Chart.js + D3.js for advanced visualizations
State: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query
WebSocket: Socket.io client for real-time updates
```

#### Infrastructure

```
Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
Orchestration: Kubernetes (production)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
Cloud: AWS (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
```

### Data Architecture

#### Primary Data Sources (Phase 1)

- **Alpha Vantage**: Real-time and historical stock data
- **News API**: Financial news for sentiment analysis
- **FRED API**: Economic indicators and macro data

#### Data Flow Pattern

```
External APIs → Ingestion Service → ETL Pipeline → Storage Layer → API Layer → Frontend
                     ↓              ↓              ↓
               Rate Limiting → Data Validation → Caching → Real-time Updates
```

#### Database Schema Design

```sql
-- Core tables for Phase 1
stocks (symbol, name, exchange, sector, market_cap)
prices (stock_id, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume)
indicators (stock_id, indicator_type, timestamp, value)
portfolios (user_id, name, created_at)
positions (portfolio_id, stock_id, quantity, avg_cost, timestamp)
```

### Development Workflow

#### Branch Strategy

```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
├── feature/* (individual features)
├── release/* (release preparation)
└── hotfix/* (production fixes)
```

#### Code Quality Standards

- **Python**: Black formatter, flake8 linting, mypy type checking
- **TypeScript**: Prettier formatter, ESLint, strict TypeScript config
- **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage, unit + integration tests
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings, API documentation, README updates

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement intelligent caching and multiple data sources
- **Data Quality**: Add comprehensive validation and anomaly detection
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one
- **ML Model Accuracy**: Use ensemble methods and continuous retraining

#### Business Risks

- **Legal Compliance**: Include disclaimers, not financial advice
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for EU users
- **Market Volatility**: Real-time risk warnings and position sizing
- **Competition**: Focus on unique analysis combinations and UX

### Success Metrics

#### Phase 1 KPIs

- [ ] Data ingestion latency < 5 seconds
- [ ] Chart rendering < 2 seconds
- [ ] 99.9% API uptime
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities

- [ ] Prediction accuracy > 60% (1-day price direction)
- [ ] User engagement > 5 minutes average session
- [ ] Portfolio tracking for 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Sub-100ms API response times

### Next Immediate Steps

#### Week 1 Priority Tasks

2. **Database Setup**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis
3. **Basic API Integration**: Alpha Vantage connection with rate limiting
4. **Design System Implementation**: Core UI components from specification
5. **Development Environment**: Hot reloading, environment variables, basic CI

#### Success Criteria for Week 1

- [ ] `npm run dev` starts frontend successfully
- [ ] `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` starts backend
- [ ] Database connection established and tested
- [ ] First API endpoint returns real stock data
- [ ] Design system components render correctly
