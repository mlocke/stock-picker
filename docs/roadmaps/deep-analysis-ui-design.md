# Roadmap for "Guided Flow" UI Design


## Project Goal:

To create a simple, intuitive, and step-by-step user interface for the Deep Analysis page, allowing users to easily select a financial sector or specific stock(s) and view a comprehensive analysis.

### Phase 1: Input & Confirmation (Weeks 1-2)

Design & Development:
Create a clean, prominent input section at the top of the page.
Implement a Sector Dropdown Menu with a clear label, populated with the financial sectors from the main navigation (e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Financial Services).
Design an Input Field for stock ticker symbols. The field should support multiple tickers, separated by commas, and include placeholder text like "e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG".
Add a large, visually distinct "Run Deep Analysis" button that activates the process.
Develop a collapsible confirmation panel that appears after the user makes a selection. This panel will display a summary of the user's choice (e.g., "Analyzing: Technology Sector" or "Analyzing: AAPL, GOOG, MSFT").
Include a "Confirm" and "Cancel" button within the panel, giving the user a final chance to review their input.

### Phase 2: Loading & User Feedback (Week 3)

### Design & Development:
Create a loading state animation to display while the analysis is running. This could be a simple spinner or a progress bar with a message like "Running complex algorithms..." to reassure the user that the process is underway.
Add real-time status updates below the loading animation (e.g., "Gathering data...", "Analyzing trends...", "Generating charts...").
Implement error handling to provide clear, friendly messages if the analysis fails (e.g., "Could not find data for that ticker. Please check the symbol and try again.").

### Phase 3: Results Display (Weeks 4-6)

### Design & Development:
Design a structured results section that initially remains hidden and populates once the analysis is complete.
Implement a tabbed interface to organize the data into logical categories. Suggested tabs include:
Key Financial Metrics: A data table displaying fundamental metrics like P/E Ratio, EPS, Revenue Growth, etc.
Performance & Trends: An interactive chart area to show historical stock price, volume, and other trends.
Sentiment & News Analysis: A section that displays a sentiment score (e.g., "Bullish") and a feed of recent, relevant news headlines.
Ensure the results are responsive and easy to read on both desktop and mobile devices.
Add a "Download Report" button in a prominent location, allowing users to export the full analysis as a PDF or CSV file.
