## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Quality Framework
- Freshness scoring based on timestamp
- Completeness scoring based on required fields
- Accuracy scoring via cross-validation
- Source reputation based on historical performance

### Caching Strategy
- Redis TTL by data type:
  - Real-time prices: 30 seconds
  - Daily data: 4 hours
  - Historical data: 24 hours
  - Static data: 7 days

### Rate Limiting
- Request quotas per API source
- Exponential backoff for failures
- Priority queuing for critical requests
- Request pooling and batching

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation to cached data
- Fallback to alternative sources
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages

## API Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
# Government APIs
SEC_EDGAR_API_KEY=your_sec_key
TREASURY_API_KEY=your_treasury_key
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
BLS_API_KEY=your_bls_key
EIA_API_KEY=your_eia_key

# Financial APIs
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_av_key
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_key
DAPPIER_API_KEY=your_dappier_key

# Rate Limiting
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30

# Caching
REDIS_TTL_REALTIME=30
REDIS_TTL_DAILY=14400
REDIS_TTL_HISTORICAL=86400
```

### API Rate Limits
- SEC EDGAR: 10 requests/second
- Treasury: 1000 requests/hour
- FRED: 120 requests/minute
- BLS: 500 requests/day
- EIA: 1000 requests/hour
- Alpha Vantage: 25 requests/day (free tier)
- FMP: 250 requests/day (free tier)
- Dappier: 1000 requests/month

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
